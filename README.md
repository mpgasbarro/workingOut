# Pick Things Up and Put Them Down

## Project Description

My app is a library of some of the most common exercises, for specific muscle groups. I want to build an application where the user can comb through a variety of exercises, for each specific muscle group, as well as choose pre-determined workouts, if they so choose. As a user, they will also be able to add to the library themselves, if they so choose. It will include information about the workout and a video tutorial on how to properly perform the exercise.
